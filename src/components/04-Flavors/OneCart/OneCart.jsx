        <h3>Cucumber/Mint</h3>
        <p>
          Delightfully crisp yet refreshingly pretentious, this immaculate
          combination of cucumber, mint, and alcohol is as light as it is
          delicious. Itâ€™s the perfect reward after a half-assed workout and the
          ideal remedy for a night in with the in-laws.
